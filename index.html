  <h2>Mental Health Information & Effects</h2>
	<div id="mentalhealth" style="display:none;">

    <p>Anxiety and depression affect a high percentage of college students and people in general. Common symptoms of <u>anxiety</u> and <u>depression</u> are uncontrollable stress and worry, increased sadness, isolation, anger, irregular sleep and increased fatigue, decreased appetite, decreased interest in your hobbies and/or studies, and extreme burn out. These symptoms are quite debilitating and can have adverse affects on one's educational career.</p>

		<p>Mental health issues come in all shapes and sizes. There are mental health issues we all face in our day-to-day college lives. Everyone has their own life to live. And while our site isn't magic, it won't cure anything, we hope it will provide some helpful resources to utilize when under stress, experiencing symptoms, etc. Stay safe!</p>

  <h2>Tips for Anxiety!</h2>
  <div id="anxietytips" style="display:none;">

    <p>Students' mental health is affected by anxiety in several different ways. Certain situations where most would feel at ease, people suffering from anxiety will feel very stressed and frightened. Translating this to a scholastic environment, anxiety can affect the ways students feel in classrooms, around other people, handling homework assignments, time management, tests or examinations, and more. Due to these stressful situations, students suffering with anxiety may look to avoid things entirely that cause them stress like social situations or exams. A danger in anxiety is when panic attacks, or sudden and intense bursts of fear during a situation, occur causing sudden distress to the student.</p>

		<p>Ways to help with anxiety in the classroom/school environment is for professors to give students more time with assignments, give students special, safe environments surrounded by others who are there to help like good work partners. If you need mental health support, try reaching out to the DRC via the Accomodate portal or by email!</p>

		<p>In day to day life, anxiety can be helped by listening to music, carrying grounding items, and simply knowing your own personal limits. You can never completely prevent anxiety as it is a natural human response, but you can always be ready to ground and support yourself when the anxiety strikes.</p>

  <h2>Tips for Depression!</h2>
  <div id="depressiontips" style="display:none;">

    <p>There has been a steady increase in depression among students and young adults. Social Media has been the number one factor contributing to the increase in young adults dealing with depression. Many other factors also exist like family problems, self-esteem, loneliness, bullying, etc. It can show in a number of different ways like disinterest in things one may have enjoyed before, extreme sadness, lack of motivation, easily angered, weight gain/loss, suicidal thoughts, feelings of worthlessness, etc. Signs that a young adult or student may particularly show include: outburst, lack of attendance in school, changed sleep patterns(lack of or more of), sensitivity, abusing drugs and alcohol.</p>

		<p>Some daily life tips for depression would be trying to take a walk, wash your face, eat something, even little things can help you get out of that funk. But if you are truly experiencing a severe depressive episode, we advise ignoring us, a bunch of random students, and seeking professional medical help via a doctor, psych, or the DRC or CAPS here on campus.</p>

		<p>Developing counseling services to help aid these mental health issues is crucial to students, especially young students who are still growing and developing. If there are services dedicated to the care these students need, students suffering with any of these disorders or issues will know that there is help. Knowing there is a positive community ready to support them will help them battle whatever they are suffering with and hopefully it will help them live more normally which will reflect in their studies.</p>
